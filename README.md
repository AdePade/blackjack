Blackjack Card Game


Rules of Blackjack:
The goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over or to have a higher hand than the dealer.  The game starts with both the player and dealer being dealt 2 cards each. If the player has 21, they win! If not, they keep drawing until they feel like their hand is closest to 21, without going over. Once the player is satisfied with the cards, they have they call STAND. Then it the dealer turn. If either the dealer or the player cards add up to more than 21, then they BUST!!! Which means they automatically lose.
